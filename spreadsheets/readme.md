These spreadsheets provide an alternative/supplement to the Colab notebooks. It can be easier to play with the values of the spreadsheets cells rather than the Python variables, but on the other hand, the Python code and equations are much more human-readable.

Note that the spreadsheet version of the Clash Royale balance analysis is quite a bit simplified, and completing all the exercises of the Colab notebook is very challenging in a spreadsheet.
