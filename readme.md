This repository contains materials and code for Aalto University's Game Analysis class, instructed by [Prof. Perttu Hämäläinen](http://perttu.info).

**Course contents:**

The course is a one week workshop, with approximately 8 hours per day:

* Day 1: Game analysis and research intro
* Day 2: Game design math, balancing, analytics. We will heavily utilize Colab notebooks (see below).
* Day 3: Psychology of game design: Behavioral game design, behavioral economics, monetization
* Day 4: Psychology of game design: Intrinsic motivation, emotion
* Day 5: Understanding the human body: Motor learning and performance for action game design, movement-based games. We usually conclude with a visit to [Valo Motion](https://valomotion.com) or Hoplop Pasila where Valo's climbing and trampoline games can be experienced.

**Approach:**

The course consists of lectures, exercises, and a [final assignment](lectures/final_assignment_instructions.pdf).  

Day 2 math and analytics exercises use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) and the Python notebooks in this repository. There are two notebooks that form a continuum with exercises of progressive difficulty. It is not expected that all students will complete all exercises. If one has zero programming experience, one might only work on the first notebook.

* [Intro: churn, virality, monetization](https://colab.research.google.com/github/PerttuHamalainen/GameAnalysis/blob/master/RetentionAndVirality.ipynb).

* [Advanced: Clash Royale balance analysis](https://colab.research.google.com/github/PerttuHamalainen/GameAnalysis/blob/master/ClashRoyaleBalance.ipynb). We look at card cost/benefit curves based on a Kaggle dataset of card stats.

Note that we were previously using spreadsheets for similar exercises, and the old Excel files are provided in the spreadsheets folder in case someone is interested. In game analytics and data science, Python notebooks have largely replaced spreadsheets, and it's reasonable to assume that the same will happen in game design, although spreadsheets are still commonly used right now.
