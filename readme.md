# Game Analysis a.k.a. The Science of Game Design

This repository contains materials and code for Aalto University's Game Analysis class, 6cr, instructed by [Prof. Perttu Hämäläinen](http://perttu.info).

**Syllabus and materials**

The course is designed for a 6-week period, with 5 hours of contact teaching per week. The course consists of lectures, exercises, and a final assignment:

* Intro: What are games and game design? What interesting things lie at the fringes of the definitions? How can research and science help in creating games? [Lecture slides](lectures/Intro%20to%20game%20analysis%20and%20research.pdf)
* Emergence and game design. [Lecture slides](lectures/MDA_and_emergence.pdf)
* Game design math, balancing, analytics. Lecture slides: [Part 1](lectures/Game_design_math_part1.pdf), [Part 2](lectures/Game_design_math_part2.pdf). Colab notebook exercises: [Intro: churn, virality, monetization](https://colab.research.google.com/github/PerttuHamalainen/GameAnalysis/blob/master/RetentionAndVirality.ipynb), [Advanced: Clash Royale balance analysis](https://colab.research.google.com/github/PerttuHamalainen/GameAnalysis/blob/master/ClashRoyaleBalance.ipynb). Note that we don't expect all students to complete all exercises. If one has zero programming experience, one might only work on the first notebook.
* Psychology of game design: Behavioral game design, computational rationality, reward design. [Lecture slides](lectures/Psychology_of_games_part1_behavioral%20game%20design.pdf)
* Psychology of game design: Intrinsic motivation [Lecture slides](lectures/Psychology_of_games_part2_intrinsic%20motivation.pdf)
* Psychology of game design: Emotion [Lecture slides](lectures/Psychology_of_games_part3_emotion.pdf)
* Doing one's own research in a limited time: AI-assisted thematic analysis [Lecture slides](lectures/Do_your_own_research.pdf). Exercise notebooks: [1. Scraping Reddit Data](https://colab.research.google.com/github/PerttuHamalainen/LLMCode/blob/master/reddit_scraping.ipynb), [2. Coding the scraped data](https://colab.research.google.com/github/PerttuHamalainen/LLMCode/blob/master/reddit_coding.ipynb), [3. Identifying themes](https://colab.research.google.com/github/PerttuHamalainen/LLMCode/blob/master/theme_generation.ipynb).
* Understanding the human body: Motor learning and performance for action game design, movement-based games. Lecture slides: [Part 1](lectures/intrinsic_motivation_in_movement.pdf), [Part 2](lectures/Perception_action_and_motor_control_101.pdf)
* Related to above: A visit to [Valo Motion](https://valomotion.com) or [Hoplop Pasila](https://www.hoplop.fi/sisaleikkipuisto/helsinki-pasila) where Valo's climbing and trampoline games can be experienced.
* [Final assignment](lectures/final_assignment_instructions.pdf). Go deeper into a topic of your choice, individually or in groups. Final assignment tutoring details provided during class. Typically, there will be tutoring times available during the last week, and we're happy to answer any questions during or after the regular teaching hours.

**Spreadsheets**

Before starting with the math and balancing Colab notebooks, you might also check the old (simplified) Excel spreadsheet versions of the same:

* [spreadsheets/monetization_forecast.xlsx](spreadsheets/monetization_forecast.xlsx)
* [spreadsheets/Clash_Royale_cards_balance.xlsx](spreadsheets/Clash_Royale_cards_balance.xlsx)

Although game designers still often use spreadsheets, they are generally being replaced or at least augmented with notebooks, e.g., in game data science. The values in spreadsheet cells might be easier to tweak, but on the other hand, the Python code and equations are more human-readable, and Python enables more complex simulations.
